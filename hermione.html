Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson[2] (born 15 April 1990)[3] is a British actress, model, and activist. Born in Paris and brought up in Oxfordshire,

 Watson attended the Dragon School as a child and trained as an actress at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts. She rose to prominence
 
 after landing her first professional acting role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter film series, appearing in all eight Harry Potter films
 
 from 2001 to 2011, previously having acted only in school plays.[4] The franchise earned Watson worldwide fame, critical accolades, and more than
 
 Â£10 million.[5] She continued to work outside of the Harry Potter films, first lending her voice to The Tale of Despereaux and appearing in the
 
 television adaptation of the novel Ballet Shoes. Since then, she has taken on starring roles in The Perks of Being a Wallflower and The Bling Ring,
 
 made a brief appearance as an "exaggerated" version of herself in This Is the End,[6] and portrayed the title character's adopted daughter in Noah.[7]
